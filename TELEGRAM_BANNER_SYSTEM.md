```

### Programmatic Usage

```typescript
import { 
  updateCouncilMemberBanner,
  updateDepartmentBanner,
  updateSystemBanner,
  updateAllCouncilBanners,
  updateAllDepartmentBanners,
  listAllTopics,
  getCouncilMember,
  getDepartment
} from './tgk/integrations/telegram-banner.js';

// Update council member banner
await updateCouncilMemberBanner('alice.smith', {
  message: 'Working on infrastructure improvements',
  priority: 'medium'
});

// Update department banner
await updateDepartmentBanner('tech', {
  message: 'Deploying new features to production',
  priority: 'high'
});

// Update system banner
await updateSystemBanner('main', {
  message: 'System maintenance complete',
  priority: 'low'
});

// List all topics
const topics = await listAllTopics();
console.log(`Found ${topics.length} topics`);
```

## Configuration

### Council Members

Council member configurations are defined in `COUNCIL_MEMBERS`:

```typescript
const COUNCIL_MEMBERS = {
  'alice.smith': {
    name: 'Alice Smith',
    emoji: 'üî¥',
    role: 'tech-lead',
    bannerTopic: 'council-alice-updates',
    personalTopic: 'alice-smith-activities',
    color: '#FF6B6B'
  },
  // ... other members
};
```

### Departments

Department configurations are defined in `DEPARTMENT_TOPICS`:

```typescript
const DEPARTMENT_TOPICS = {
  'tech': {
    name: 'Tech Department',
    emoji: 'üíô',
    bannerTopic: 'tech-department-banner',
    updatesTopic: 'tech-updates',
    alertsTopic: 'tech-alerts',
    color: '#00BFFF'
  },
  // ... other departments
};
```

### System Topics

System-wide topics are defined in `SYSTEM_TOPICS`:

```typescript
const SYSTEM_TOPICS = {
  'main': {
    name: 'Main Banner',
    topic: 'main-banner',
    description: 'Primary system status and announcements'
  },
  // ... other system topics
};
```

## Message Formatting

### Priority Levels

- `low`: ‚ÑπÔ∏è - Informational messages
- `medium`: üìã - Standard updates
- `high`: ‚ö†Ô∏è - Important announcements
- `critical`: üö® - Urgent alerts

### Banner Structure

Each banner message includes:
- Council member/department emoji and name
- Priority indicator
- Status update message
- Role or department information
- Timestamp
- System attribution

### Color System

The system uses a macro-based color system that:
- Strips ANSI colors in Telegram client mode
- Preserves colors in development mode
- Provides compile-time color optimization
- Supports council member and department color schemes

## Testing

### Unit Tests

```bash
# Run banner system tests
bun test-telegram-banner.mjs

# Run RPC integration tests
bun test-telegram-banner-rpc.mjs
```

### Test Coverage

The test suite validates:
- Banner topic listing and configuration
- Council member and department lookups
- Message formatting and structure
- Priority level handling
- RPC integration (with mock credentials)
- CLI command functionality

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Missing Telegram Credentials**
   ```
   Error: TELEGRAM_API_ID and TELEGRAM_API_HASH environment variables are required
   ```
   Solution: Set up proper environment variables with Telegram API credentials.

2. **Bot Permissions**
   ```
   Error: CHAT_ADMIN_REQUIRED
   ```
   Solution: Ensure the bot has administrator privileges in the supergroup.

3. **Forum Topics Not Enabled**
   ```
   Error: FORUM_REQUIRED
   ```
   Solution: Enable forum topics in your Telegram supergroup settings.

4. **Invalid Topic ID**
   ```
   Error: INVALID_TOPIC_ID
   ```
   Solution: Verify the topic exists and the bot has access to it.

### Debug Mode

Enable debug logging by setting:
```bash
DEBUG=telegram:* bun tgk/commands/banner.ts test
```

## Integration with AI Orchestration

- Automated banner updates based on system events
- AI-generated status messages
- Integration with release planning workflows
- Coordination with incident response systems
- Synchronization with CODEOWNERS and review processes

## Security Considerations

- Store Telegram API credentials securely
- Use environment variables for sensitive configuration

- Validate all user inputs before processing
- Monitor for unauthorized API usage

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- Scheduled banner updates
- Template-based message customization
- Integration with monitoring systems
- Multi-supergroup support
- Advanced analytics and reporting
- Webhook-based real-time updates
