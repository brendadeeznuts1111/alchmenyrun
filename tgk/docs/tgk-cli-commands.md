Confidence: 92.5%
Reasoning: Customer-facing security issue detected. High impact - production system affected.
```

#### `tgk ai release-type`
AI-powered release type suggestion based on commit analysis.

```bash
# Default repository
tgk ai release-type

# Specific repository
tgk ai release-type --repo alchmenyrun

## Configuration

### Environment Variables

- `GITHUB_TOKEN`: GitHub API token for repository access
- `TELEGRAM_BOT_TOKEN`: Telegram bot token for notifications
- `TELEGRAM_COUNCIL_ID`: Telegram council chat ID for approvals
- `TGK_USER`: Default username for approvals and attribution

### Default Repository

TGK defaults to `brendadeeznuts1111/alchmenyrun` but can work with any GitHub repository using the `--repo` option or `owner/repo` format.

## Error Handling

All commands include comprehensive error handling:
- Graceful degradation when tokens are unavailable
- Test mode simulation for development
- Clear error messages and usage instructions
- Automatic retry for transient failures

## Security Considerations

- **Token Security**: All tokens are handled securely and never logged
- **Permission Awareness**: Commands respect user permissions
- **Audit Logging**: All actions are logged for accountability
- **Human Oversight**: Critical actions require human approval

## Future Enhancements

Planned improvements include:
- **Advanced AI Models**: Integration with more sophisticated AI services
- **Custom Taxonomies**: Support for organization-specific label taxonomies
- **Workflow Templates**: Pre-defined workflow templates for common scenarios
