## Enhanced Email Routing Grammar

### Format: `[DOMAIN].[SCOPE].[TYPE].[HIERARCHY].[META].[STATE_ID]@cloudflare.com`

#### Token Specifications

| Field | Max Length | Examples | Purpose |
|-------|------------|----------|---------|
| DOMAIN | 12 | `infra`, `support`, `exec` | Team sub-domain |
| SCOPE | 10 | `oncall`, `sre`, `dev` | Role or process |
| TYPE | 10 | `alert`, `issue`, `reply` | Event class |
| HIERARCHY | 5 | `p0`, `p1`, `crit` | Urgency level |
| META | 6 | `gh`, `jira`, `cf` | Source system |
| STATE_ID | 8 | `inc123`, `pr45` | Entity identifier |

#### Example Addresses

- `infra.sre.alert.p0.cf.inc123@cloudflare.com` → Critical CF alert for SRE on incident #123
- `support.oncall.issue.p1.jira.bug42@cloudflare.com` → P1 issue from Jira #42 to current support on-call
- `qa.dev.reply.p2.tg.pr51@cloudflare.com` → Developer reply to Telegram thread about PR #51

## AI-Powered Features

### Email Content Analysis

```bash
tgk ai analyze-email "Critical Server Down" "Production server is down affecting customers"
```

**Analysis Includes:**
- Sentiment detection (positive/negative/neutral)
- Urgency classification (low/medium/high/critical)
- Keyword extraction
- Action item identification
- PII detection
- Phishing risk assessment

### Dynamic Routing Suggestions

```bash
tgk ai suggest-routing infra sre alert p0 cf --state-id inc123
```

**Routing Logic:**
- Scope-based routing (oncall → current on-call engineer)
- Domain-based routing (support → support team)
- Incident-specific routing (inc123 → incident channel)
- AI-driven priority overrides
- Risk-based filtering (blocks high phishing risk)

### Email Reply Drafting

```bash
tgk ai draft-email "Server Issue" "Server is down" "customer@company.com" --intent investigating --tone professional
```

**Reply Options:**
- Intent: `acknowledge`, `investigating`, `resolved`, `escalate`
- Tone: `professional`, `casual`, `urgent`
- Context-aware content generation
- Confidence scoring

## Orchestration Commands

### Email Reply Orchestration

```bash
tgk orchestrate email-reply msg_12345 customer@company.com \
  --subject "Re: Server Issue" \
