## Best Practices

### Operational Guidelines
1. **Test Before Production**: Always test orchestrate commands in staging
2. **Monitor Telegram**: Keep an eye on council notifications
3. **Regular Audits**: Schedule periodic compliance audits
4. **Policy Updates**: Keep OPA policies current and relevant
5. **Token Security**: Regularly rotate and secure access tokens

### Troubleshooting
- **Check Tokens**: Verify GitHub and Telegram tokens are valid
- **Review Logs**: Check console output for detailed error information
