## 🎯 Governance Framework

### 1. Capacity Management Policy

#### Stream Capacity Limits
- **Security:** 5 topics (high-stakes, needs focus)
- **SRE:** 8 topics (broad infrastructure scope)
- **Data:** 6 topics (analytics + pipelines)
- **Product:** 4 topics (feature-focused)
- **Performance:** 3 topics (specialized optimization)
- **Compliance:** 3 topics (regulatory focus)

#### Capacity Triggers
- **🟢 Healthy:** < 60% utilization
- **🟡 Monitoring:** 60-80% utilization
- **🔴 At Risk:** > 80% utilization
- **🚫 Blocked:** At 100% utilization

### 2. Topic Lifecycle Management

#### Creation Process
```bash
# Pre-creation governance check
tgk forum governance create <stream> <title> <owner>

# Output: Capacity check + generated name
# Status: ✅ APPROVED or ❌ AT CAPACITY
```

#### Quality Gates (Required)
- [ ] Clear, descriptive title (< 50 chars)
- [ ] Assigned stream owner (@handle)
- [ ] Linked RFC if applicable
- [ ] Purpose statement in first message

#### Lifecycle Stages
1. **Active:** < 30 days, regular activity
2. **Dormant:** 30-60 days, occasional activity
3. **Stale:** 60-90 days, minimal activity
4. **Archive:** > 90 days inactive

### 3. Archival & Cleanup Policy

#### Automatic Archival Criteria
- 90+ days since last message
- No active RFCs linked
- No pending reviews
- Owner approval obtained

#### Archival Process
```bash
# Check archival eligibility
tgk forum governance archive <stream> <topic_id>

# Output: Qualification assessment
# Action: Preserve messages, mark read-only
```

#### Manual Intervention Triggers
- Topic reaches 80% of stream capacity
- Quality issues identified
- Duplicate or redundant topics
- Stream restructuring required
