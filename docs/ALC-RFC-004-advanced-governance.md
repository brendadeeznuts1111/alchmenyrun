# ALC-RFC-004: Advanced Forum Governance Features

## Status
- **ALC:** 004
- **Title:** Advanced Forum Governance Features
- **Author:** Governance Committee
- **Date:** 2025-10-27
- **Status:** Draft
- **Related Documents**
  - **Technical Feasibility Assessment:** `docs/ALC-RFC-004-technical-feasibility.md`
  - **Previous RFCs:** ALC-RFC-001, ALC-RFC-002, ALC-RFC-003

## Summary

This RFC proposes advanced governance features for the Alchemy forum, including AI-powered topic categorization, cross-stream relationships, predictive capacity planning, and automated topic prioritization.

## Motivation

Current governance (ALC-RFC-003) provides basic capacity management and lifecycle controls. As forum usage grows to 21+ topics, advanced features are needed to:

- Prevent topic sprawl through intelligent categorization
- Optimize resource allocation with predictive analytics
- Automate routine governance decisions
- Enable cross-functional collaboration

## Goals

1. **Intelligent Categorization:** AI-powered topic stream assignment
2. **Predictive Planning:** Capacity forecasting and automated adjustments
3. **Cross-Stream Collaboration:** Topic relationships and dependencies
4. **Automated Prioritization:** Smart topic importance ranking
5. **Advanced Analytics:** Governance effectiveness measurement

## Proposed Features

### 1. AI-Powered Topic Categorization

#### Problem
Manual stream assignment is error-prone and inconsistent.

#### Solution
```bash
# AI-assisted topic creation
tgk forum governance create --ai "New analytics dashboard" @alice

# Output includes AI-suggested stream
🎯 AI Stream Suggestion: data (87% confidence)
📊 Alternative suggestions:
   • product (12% confidence)
   • performance (1% confidence)

# User can override or accept
✅ Accept AI suggestion? [Y/n]:
```

#### Implementation
- Natural language processing of topic titles and descriptions
- Machine learning model trained on historical categorizations
- Confidence scoring with fallback to manual assignment

### 2. Predictive Capacity Planning

#### Problem
Reactive capacity management leads to bottlenecks.

#### Solution
```bash
# Predictive capacity analysis
tgk forum governance predict --horizon 90

# Output shows projected utilization
📈 CAPACITY FORECAST (90 days)
• Security: 4/5 → 5/5 (⚠️ 100% by day 45)
• SRE: 5/8 → 7/8 (✅ 88% by day 90)
• Data: 4/6 → 6/6 (⚠️ 100% by day 30)
• Product: 2/4 → 3/4 (✅ 75% by day 90)

📋 Recommendations:
• Increase Data capacity to 8 topics
• Monitor Security stream closely
• Consider SRE capacity increase
```

#### Implementation
- Time-series analysis of topic creation rates
- Seasonal trend analysis
- Automated capacity adjustment recommendations

### 3. Cross-Stream Topic Relationships

#### Problem
Topics often span multiple streams without clear linkages.

#### Solution
```bash
# Link related topics across streams
tgk forum governance link 123 456 --relationship "depends-on"

# Visualize topic relationships
tgk forum governance graph security 789

# Output shows dependency tree
🛡️ Security Topic #789: "API Authentication"
├── 📊 Data Topic #456: "User Analytics" (depends-on)
├── ⚙️ SRE Topic #123: "API Gateway" (blocks)
└── ✨ Product Topic #234: "Login UX" (related)
```

#### Implementation
- Topic relationship metadata storage
- Graph database for relationship queries
- Visual dependency mapping

### 4. Automated Topic Prioritization

#### Problem
All topics treated equally, leading to attention dilution.

#### Solution
```bash
# Calculate topic priority scores
tgk forum governance prioritize --stream data

# Output ranked by priority
📊 DATA STREAM PRIORITY RANKING
━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━━
🥇 Topic #456: "Real-time Analytics" (Priority: 9.2/10)

## Reviewer Feedback

### Suggestions for Implementation

1. **Start Simpler** - Begin with AI categorization only, then layer on other features iteratively
2. **Add Governance Guardrails** - Include manual override mechanisms and human-in-the-loop approvals for critical decisions
3. **Consider Incremental Adoption** - Pilot on one stream first (as mentioned) rather than organization-wide rollout
4. **Define Success Criteria More Specifically** - Replace qualitative metrics like "improved forum organization" with objective, measurable KPIs

## Data Privacy & Security

### Data Classification
Topic metadata contains the following data classifications:

**Personally Identifiable Information (PII):**
- Stakeholder usernames (e.g., "@alice", "@bob", "@charlie")
- Email addresses (if included in stakeholder lists)
- User identification data linked to forum participants

**Non-sensitive Data:**
- Topic titles and descriptions
- Stream assignments and categories
- Priority scores and engagement metrics
- RFC references and deadline dates
- Relationship mappings and dependency data

### External AI Service Agreements
The external AI categorization service must comply with:
- **Data Processing Agreement (DPA):** Required for all data transfers
- **Business Associate Agreement (BAA):** If handling health-related forum topics
- **Service Level Agreement (SLA):** 99.9% uptime, <24hr data deletion upon request
- **Security Assessment:** Annual SOC 2 Type II or equivalent certification

### PII Handling Controls
**Data Anonymization Requirements:**
- Stakeholder usernames must be hashed or tokenized before external transmission
- Email addresses must be masked (e.g., "alice@domain.com" → "a***e@d***n.com")
- Direct identifiers removed from topic metadata sent to AI service

**Transmission Security:**
- All data encrypted in transit (TLS 1.3+)
- API authentication via OAuth 2.0 or API keys with rotation
- Rate limiting and request validation implemented

### Retention and Deletion Policies
**External Service Data Retention:**
- Maximum retention: 30 days for processing logs
- Immediate deletion upon categorization completion
- No long-term storage of topic content or PII
- Automated deletion processes with audit trails

**Local Data Retention:**
- Topic metadata retained per existing governance policies
- PII handling follows platform data retention standards
- Audit logs maintained for 2 years minimum

### Audit and Logging Approach
**Local Audit Controls:**
- All AI service interactions logged with request/response metadata
- PII transmission events flagged and monitored
- Access controls: governance team only, with audit logging
- Quarterly review of external service data handling

**External Service Auditing:**
- Annual third-party security assessments
- Data processing activity reports provided quarterly
- Incident response procedures documented and tested

- [GDPR Compliance Guidelines](/docs/gdpr-compliance.md)
- [Data Processing Agreement Template](/docs/dpa-template.md)
