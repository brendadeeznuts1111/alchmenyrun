## 🔄 Integration with ALC-RFC-004

### AI-Powered Categorization Support
The banner system now supports the governance features outlined in ALC-RFC-004:

- **Stream Assignment**: System topics are properly categorized by governance streams
- **Owner Identification**: Each topic has a designated owner from the council
- **Priority Management**: Banner updates support priority levels for governance workflows
- **Analytics Integration**: Dedicated analytics banner for metrics and reporting

### Capacity Planning Alignment
Banner topics are structured to support capacity planning:
- **Department Limits**: Each department has dedicated banner, updates, and alerts topics
- **Stream Organization**: System topics organized by governance streams
- **Resource Tracking**: Banner metadata includes team and ownership information

## 📊 Usage Examples

### Automated File-Based Updates
```bash
# When infrastructure files change
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts file-update "src/backend/server.ts" "API server updated with new endpoints"

# When documentation is updated
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts file-update "docs/api.md" "API documentation refreshed"

# When tests are added
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts file-update "src/__tests__/new.test.ts" "Test coverage expanded"
```

### Governance Workflow Integration
```bash
# RFC announcement
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts system governance "ALC-RFC-004 implementation started"

# Analytics reporting
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts system analytics "Q4 governance metrics available"

# Incident response
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts system incidents "Security incident resolved - see post-mortem"
```

### Team Coordination
```bash
# Infrastructure deployment
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts department infrastructure "Deployment window open - services may be unavailable"

# Provider updates
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts department resource-providers "New AWS provider features available"

# Quality gates
bun tgk/commands/banner.ts department quality-testing "Quality gate passed - ready for release"
```

## 🔍 Validation and Testing

### File Path Validation
The system validates file paths against CODEOWNERS patterns:
- **Glob Pattern Matching**: Supports `*`, `**`, and path patterns
- **Recursive Directory Matching**: Handles nested directory structures
- **Extension-Based Matching**: Matches file extensions correctly
- **Fallback Handling**: Graceful handling of unmapped files

### Team Structure Validation
- **Council Member Verification**: Validates council member IDs and roles
- **Department Lead Assignment**: Ensures each department has a valid lead
- **Stream Ownership**: Verifies system topic ownership
- **Responsibility Mapping**: Validates CODEOWNERS responsibility assignments

## 🚀 Production Deployment

### Environment Configuration
```bash
# Required environment variables
export TELEGRAM_COUNCIL_ID="your_supergroup_id"
export TELEGRAM_API_ID="your_api_id"
