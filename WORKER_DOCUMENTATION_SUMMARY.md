## 🚀 **Enhancement Roadmap**

### **✅ Phase 1: Production Essentials**
```typescript
// Core production features
export const worker = await Worker("api", {
  name: "api-worker",
  domains: ["api.example.com"],        // ✅ Add custom domains
  routes: ["backend.example.com/*"],   // ✅ Add route patterns
  compatibilityDate: "2025-09-13",     // ✅ Add compatibility
  observability: { enabled: true },    // ✅ Add observability
  limits: { cpu_ms: 50_000 },         // ✅ Add runtime limits
});

// Queue integration
const taskQueue = await Queue("task-queue");
export const processor = await Worker("processor", {
  bindings: { TASK_QUEUE: taskQueue },
  eventSources: [{
    queue: taskQueue,
    settings: { batchSize: 15, maxConcurrency: 3 }
  }]
});

// Durable Objects
const counter = DurableObjectNamespace("counter", {
  className: "Counter",
  sqlite: true,
});
export const worker = await Worker("api", {
  bindings: { COUNTER: counter },
});
```

### **✅ Phase 2: Enhanced Capabilities**
```typescript
// Static assets
const assets = await Assets({ path: "./public" });
export const frontend = await Worker("frontend", {
  bindings: { ASSETS: assets },
  assets: { path: "./public", run_worker_first: false },
});

// Cron triggers
export const cronWorker = await Worker("cron-tasks", {
  entrypoint: "./src/cron.ts",
  crons: ["0 0 * * *", "0 */6 * * *"]
});

// Smart placement
export const optimizedWorker = await Worker("api", {
  placement: { mode: "smart" }
});
```

### **✅ Phase 3: Advanced Architecture**
```typescript
// Workflows
const orderProcessor = Workflow("order-processor", {
  workflowName: "order-processing",
  className: "OrderProcessor",
});

// Multi-tenant architecture
export const tenantWorker = await Worker("tenant-app", {
  namespace: tenants,
});

// Service mesh pattern
export const gateway = await Worker("gateway", {
  bindings: {
    USER_SERVICE: userService,
    ORDER_SERVICE: orderService,
    PAYMENT_SERVICE: paymentService
  },
});
```
