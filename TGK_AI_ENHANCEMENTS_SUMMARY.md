# TGK AI Enhancements Implementation Summary

## Order Completed: AI-Driven Issue Triage, Release Planning, and Enhanced GitHub Repo Management

This document summarizes the successful integration of AI-driven workflow orchestration enhancements into the TGK (Telegram Git Kit) system, solidifying its role as the central control plane for intelligent workflow management.

## ðŸŽ¯ Executive Summary

The TGK system has been significantly enhanced with three major AI-driven capabilities:

1. **Enhanced Issue Triage** - AI-powered labeling with confidence scoring and human-in-the-loop workflows
2. **Intelligent Release Planning** - AI-suggested version bumping based on commit analysis
3. **Comprehensive GitHub Integration** - Enhanced repository management and label application

## ðŸš€ Key Enhancements Implemented

### 1. Enhanced `tgk issue` Commands

#### New Features:
- **AI-Powered Label Suggestion**: Enhanced analysis with confidence scoring and detailed reasoning
- **Expanded Label Taxonomy**: Added `status/*` labels for workflow tracking
- **Human-in-the-Loop**: Automatic application for high-confidence (>80%) suggestions, council review for others
- **Enhanced Triage**: Improved pattern recognition for customer vs. internal issues

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// Enhanced label suggestion interface
interface LabelSuggestion {
  labels: string[];
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
}

// Enhanced AI analysis with multiple factors
async function suggestLabels(title: string, body: string): Promise<LabelSuggestion>
```

#### Command Structure:
```bash
tgk issue                   # Customer/internal issue ops
  â”œâ”€ new                     # AI-assisted wizard to create issues/PRs with auto-labels
  â””â”€ triage <id>             # AI-powered labeling and prioritization for existing issues
```

### 2. Enhanced `tgk release` Commands

#### New Features:
- **AI-Suggested Release Types**: `--type ai-suggest` option for intelligent version bumping
- **Commit Analysis**: Automatic analysis of features, fixes, and breaking changes
- **Enhanced Confidence Scoring**: Detailed reasoning for release type suggestions

#### Technical Implementation:
```typescript
// AI release type suggestion interface
interface ReleaseTypeSuggestion {
  type: 'patch' | 'minor' | 'major';
  confidence: number;
  reasoning: string;
  commit_analysis: {
    features: number;
    fixes: number;
    breaking: number;
    total: number;
  };
}

// AI-powered release type analysis
async function suggestReleaseType(): Promise<ReleaseTypeSuggestion>
```

#### Command Structure:
```bash
tgk release                 # AI-orchestrated release management
  â”œâ”€ plan --type {major|minor|patch|ai-suggest} # AI suggests type, drafts checklist, proposes impact
  â”œâ”€ approve <id>            # Council approval for release plan via Telegram
  â”œâ”€ deploy <id> --stage <stage> # Policy-gated deployment of approved plan
  â”œâ”€ promote <id> --state {candidate|stable} # Auto-updates release state
  â””â”€ announce <id>           # Multi-channel release announcement
```

export async function repositoryInfo(repoName?: string, options: { detailed?: boolean } = {})

// Enhanced label management with multiple labels and repo support
export async function manageLabels(action: string, name?: string, options: any = {})
```

#### Command Structure:
```bash
tgk github                  # GitHub repository interactions
  â”œâ”€ repo info <repo-name>   # Get details about a repository
  â””â”€ labels apply <repo-name> --issue <id> --labels "label1,label2" # Apply labels
```

### 4. Centralized AI Module (`tgk/commands/ai.ts`)

export async function suggestLabels(issueId: string, repoOwner: string, repoName: string): Promise<LabelSuggestion>

// AI release type suggestion based on commit analysis
export async function suggestReleaseType(repoOwner: string, repoName: string): Promise<ReleaseTypeSuggestion>

// AI impact analysis for releases and changes
export async function analyzeImpact(changes: string[], repoOwner: string, repoName: string): Promise<ImpactAnalysis>
```

#### Command Structure:
```bash
tgk ai                      # Centralized AI commands
  â”œâ”€ labels <id>            # AI suggests labels for issue/PR
  â”œâ”€ release-type           # AI suggests release type based on commits
  â””â”€ impact <changes...>    # AI analyzes impact of proposed changes
```
