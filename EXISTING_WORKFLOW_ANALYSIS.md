## 🏗️ **Existing Profile System**

### **✅ Multi-Environment Support**
```typescript
// Already configured in apps/demo-app/alchemy.config.ts
profiles: {
  dev: {
    // Development settings
  },
  prod: {
    // Production settings
  }
}
```

### **✅ Alchemy State Management**
- **Local State**: `./.alchemy/` with proper directory structure
- **App State**: `./apps/demo-app/.alchemy/` for app-specific state
- **Profile Support**: Environment-specific configurations
- **Credential Management**: Secure Cloudflare credential handling

## 🚀 **Existing PR Preview System**

### **✅ Automatic Preview Deployments**
Based on our `deploy.yml` workflow:

1. **PR Opened** → Automatic deployment to `pr-{number}` stage
2. **PR Updated** → Redeployment with latest changes
3. **PR Closed** → Automatic cleanup of preview resources
4. **Production Ready** → Main branch deploys to `prod` stage

### **✅ Preview URL Generation**
The workflow automatically generates preview URLs like:
- **PR Preview**: `https://demo-app-pr-{number}.example.workers.dev`
- **Production**: `https://demo-app-prod.example.workers.dev`
