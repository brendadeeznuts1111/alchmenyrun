## âœ¨ Feature Description
<!-- Clear and concise description of the proposed feature -->

### **Problem Statement**
<!-- What problem does this feature solve? -->
<!-- 
Example:
Currently, resource providers in Alchemy don't follow consistent patterns for type safety, error handling, and resource lifecycle management. This makes it difficult for contributors to implement new providers and for users to understand expected behavior.
-->

### **Proposed Solution**
<!-- How do you envision solving this problem? -->
<!-- 
Example:
Create a comprehensive set of advanced patterns that all resource providers should follow, including input normalization, type guards, deterministic naming, conditional deletion, and retry patterns. This would be implemented as a template and documentation that providers can follow.
